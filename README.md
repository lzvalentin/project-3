# Neighbors

It is a web application that encourages relationships between neighbors. This is an application that allows users in an area to interact with other people who also live in the same area. It provides an outlet to express personal and family needs such as bbq parties, pay HOA fee using stripe, lost dog, food drive or even just letting the neighborhood know you're having a pool party next week. You can even comment on the post and create posts that let the other neighbors know of the happenings in the neighborhood. In the hectic world of today what we really need is friendly neighborhood.
